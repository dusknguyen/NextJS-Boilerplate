This is a NextJS boilerplate project aimed at speeding up the development of frontend applications. It is pre-configured with best practices for project structure, TypeScript, linting, and more, making it easier to start building robust web applications.

## Features

- **Next.js** for server-side rendering and routing.
- **TypeScript** for static typing.
- **SCSS** for styling.
- **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code formatting and linting.
- Organized folder structure with components, modules, utilities, and configurations.
- **Yarn** for dependency management.
